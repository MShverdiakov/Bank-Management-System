# Bank-Management-System
## Implementation of bank management system using C++ using binary files to store data

did that project as an exercise of my knowledge in cpp.
for data storage chose binary files
#### made a class with fields:
- unique number of an account (didn't checking uniqueness thought)
- name of account holder 
- type of an account (current or saving)
- amount of money on account
#### implemented operations:
1. account creating (that data saves further)
2. deposit money (putting money on bank account)
3. withdraw money (taking money for certain account)
4. balance enquiry (how much money is on account right now)
5. all account holder list (showing data from binary file)
6. close an account (deleting account from binary file (could be too slow for big dataset because i'm making temp file))
7. modify an account (can change any data of an account, any field of class basicaly)
8. exit
I'm pretty satisfied with what i have as an output, not bad as a pet project, of course it could be better, but i realised all what i planned for that project
